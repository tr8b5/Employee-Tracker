# Description

This is an MYSQL integrated CLI application. You can track the employees, their roles, and departments with this application. This will keep track of the employee for you and save the data in the dedicated database.
This already has templates for database schema and seed. This project has taught me how to connect javascript and SQL database and manipulate data with complicated codes.
